This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: improper handling of empty lists and non-numeric input when calculating the average of a list of numbers. The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code, which crashes when encountering an empty list or a list with non-numeric elements. The `bugSolution.py` file offers a corrected version that gracefully handles these cases using exception handling and type checking.
